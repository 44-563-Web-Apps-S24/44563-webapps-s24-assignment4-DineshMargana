    <h1>“Margana Dinesh does Chekov tonight”</h1>
    <h2>THE PROPOSAL author Anton Chekov</h2>

    <P>"The Proposal" (1889) and "The Bear" (1890) may be taken as good
        examples of the sort of humour admired by the average Russian. The
        latter play, in another translation, was put on as a curtain-raiser to a
        cinematograph entertainment at a London theatre in 1914; and had quite a
        pleasant reception from a thoroughly Philistine audience. The humour is
        very nearly of the variety most popular over here, the psychology is a
        shade subtler. The Russian novelist or dramatist takes to psychology as
        some of his fellow-countrymen take to drink; in doing this he achieves
        fame by showing us what we already know, and at the same time he kills
        his own creative power. Chekhov just escaped the tragedy of suicide by
        introspection, and was only enabled to do this by the possession of
        a sense of humour. That is why we should not regard "The Bear," "The
        Wedding," or "The Anniversary" as the work of a merely humorous young
        man, but as the saving graces which made perfect "The Cherry Orchard."<br>
        CHARACTERS<br>

        STEPAN STEPANOVITCH CHUBUKOV, a landowner
        NATALYA STEPANOVNA, his daughter, twenty-five years old
        IVAN VASSILEVITCH LOMOV, a neighbour of Chubukov, a large and
        hearty, but very suspicious landowner<br>
   
   The scene is laid at CHUBUKOV's country-house<br>
   
   
   A drawing-room in CHUBUKOV'S house.<br>
   
   [LOMOV enters, wearing a dress-jacket and white gloves. CHUBUKOV rises
   to meet him.]<br>
   
   CHUBUKOV. My dear fellow, whom do I see! Ivan Vassilevitch! I am
   extremely glad! [Squeezes his hand] Now this is a surprise, my
   darling... How are you?<br>
   
   LOMOV. Thank you. And how may you be getting on?<br>
   
   CHUBUKOV. We just get along somehow, my angel, to your prayers, and
   so on. Sit down, please do.... Now, you know, you shouldn't forget all
   about your neighbours, my darling. My dear fellow, why are you so formal
   in your get-up? Evening dress, gloves, and so on. Can you be going
   anywhere, my treasure?<br>
   
   LOMOV. No, I've come only to see you, honoured Stepan Stepanovitch.<br>
   
   CHUBUKOV. Then why are you in evening dress, my precious? As if you're
   paying a New Year's Eve visit!<br>
   
   LOMOV. Well, you see, it's like this. [Takes his arm] I've come to you,
   honoured Stepan Stepanovitch, to trouble you with a request. Not once or
   twice have I already had the privilege of applying to you for help, and
   you have always, so to speak... I must ask your pardon, I am getting
   excited. I shall drink some water, honoured Stepan Stepanovitch.
   [Drinks.]<br>
   
   CHUBUKOV. [Aside] He's come to borrow money! Shan't give him any!
   [Aloud] What is it, my beauty?<br>
   
   LOMOV. You see, Honour Stepanitch... I beg pardon, Stepan Honouritch...
   I mean, I'm awfully excited, as you will please notice.... In short, you
   alone can help me, though I don't deserve it, of course... and haven't
   any right to count on your assistance....<br>
   
   CHUBUKOV. Oh, don't go round and round it, darling! Spit it out! Well?<br>
   
   LOMOV. One moment... this very minute. The fact is, I've come to ask the
   hand of your daughter, Natalya Stepanovna, in marriage.<br>
   
   CHUBUKOV. [Joyfully] By Jove! Ivan Vassilevitch! Say it again--I didn't
   hear it all!<br>
   
   LOMOV. I have the honour to ask..<br>
   
   CHUBUKOV. [Interrupting] My dear fellow... I'm so glad, and so on....
   Yes, indeed, and all that sort of thing. [Embraces and kisses LOMOV]
   I've been hoping for it for a long time. It's been my continual desire.
   [Sheds a tear] And I've always loved you, my angel, as if you were my
   own son. May God give you both His help and His love and so on, and I
   did so much hope... What am I behaving in this idiotic way for? I'm off
   my balance with joy, absolutely off my balance! Oh, with all my soul...
   I'll go and call Natasha, and all that.<br>
   
   LOMOV. [Greatly moved] Honoured Stepan Stepanovitch, do you think I may
   count on her consent?<br>
   
   CHUBUKOV. Why, of course, my darling, and... as if she won't consent!
   She's in love; egad, she's like a love-sick cat, and so on.... Shan't be
   long! [Exit.]<br>
   
   LOMOV. It's cold... I'm trembling all over, just as if I'd got an
   examination before me. The great thing is, I must have my mind made up.
   If I give myself time to think, to hesitate, to talk a lot, to look for
   an ideal, or for real love, then I'll never get married.... Brr!... It's
   cold! Natalya Stepanovna is an excellent housekeeper, not bad-looking,
   well-educated.... What more do I want? But I'm getting a noise in
   my ears from excitement. [Drinks] And it's impossible for me not to
   marry.... In the first place, I'm already 35--a critical age, so to
   speak. In the second place, I ought to lead a quiet and regular life....
   I suffer from palpitations, I'm excitable and always getting awfully
   upset.... At this very moment my lips are trembling, and there's a
   twitch in my right eyebrow.... But the very worst of all is the way
   I sleep. I no sooner get into bed and begin to go off when suddenly
   something in my left side--gives a pull, and I can feel it in my
   shoulder and head.... I jump up like a lunatic, walk about a bit, and
   lie down again, but as soon as I begin to get off to sleep there's
   another pull! And this may happen twenty times.</P>
